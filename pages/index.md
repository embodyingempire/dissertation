### Description

“Embodying the Empire: Women, Succession, and Dynasty in the Third Century,” explores the ideology developed between the imperial administration and specific populations during the reigns of three third century Roman empresses, Julia Domna, Otacilia Severa, and Galeria Valeria, and ruled beside their husbands and sons between 193 to 311 CE. This dissertation examines how imperial propaganda was catered towards specific populations, elites, non-elites, and women, responded to imperial proclaimations in the form of inscriptions and other less-studied specimens including jewelry, sartorial adornment, hair, dolls, and cameos.
