This chapter explores the creation of imperial propaganda and how the emperor communicated with his subjects through crowns, decrees, and, most commonly, coinage. Imperial coinage reflects the agenda and virtues that the emperor wanted to advertise to specific audiences. The emphasis of family members on coinage and state media demonstrated the longevity of the emperor’s reign beyond his death and ensured a smooth peaceful succession.  Even emperors that ruled without a Caesar, co-Augustus, or a dynasty employed traditional dynastic features to affirm their role as guarantors of political stability.  Celebrations of the imperial family in official media presented narratives of domestic harmony and enhanced the emperor’s validity; if the emperor could not maintain his own household, then he was not fit to run the empire nor military. Imperial mints issued multiple reverse types for imperial wives that advertised certain aspects and ideals the imperial administration sought to emphasize. Motherhood was the prevailing theme in most empresses’ coin types. Reverse legends like pietas, puditicia, felicitas, and concordia expressed the empress’ role in the dynasty as a wife and mother. Depictions of maternal and domestic deities like Juno, Venus, and Vesta combined with legends were visible expressions of a prosperous dynasty.  The motherhood propaganda associated with empresses invites a sort of public surveillance over her body sexual behavior. If the wife/mother did not maintain her chastity or devotion to her domus, then the successor’s legitimacy which is based upon inheritance and family legacy is destroyed
