Hi, I am Christina Hotalen, a Doctoral Candidate in Ancient History at the University of South Florida. My academic interests include cultural history, gender and sexuality, ethnicity and identity, and material culture, especially art and coinage. My approach to ancient history is interdisciplinary, drawing on art history, fine art, anthropology, gender studies, numismatics, epigraphy, archaeology, digital methodologies, and quantitative analysis. I let the data speak for itself and thus draw analyses and conclusions based on the results.

My dissertation, entitled "Embodying the Empire: Women, Succession, and Dynasty in the Third Century," explores the ideology developed between the imperial administration and specific populations during the reigns of three third century Roman empresses, Julia Domna, Otacilia Severa, and Galeria Valeria, and ruled beside their husbands and sons between 193 to 311 CE. The imperial administrations of each emperor targeted propaganda towards specific populations. The messages were designed to elicit a population’s support for the emperor’s legitimacy and his dynastic pretentions. Cities, provincial governors, and military units responded to imperial propaganda by erecting inscriptions in honor of the imperial families, and sometimes of the empresses alone. My dissertation addresses propaganda concerning the empresses and the responses of various audiences to it, including some less well studied groups: elite women, freedmen, and rank and file soldiers. Their responses take the form of inscriptions as well as less conventional artifacts such as dolls, cameos, and jewelry. When viewed together, imperial propaganda and the broad range of responses to it reveal how a variety of diverse groups employed the empresses’ images to create a sense of membership and participation in the empire. Subjects were expected to embrace the administration’s narrative in order to have meaningful political and personal relationship with the emperor.
